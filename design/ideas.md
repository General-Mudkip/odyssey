# Odyssey

## Design
- An ancient Greek theme. Use a Duolingo style of art?
- Use the following terminology:
    * Argonauts = Child users
    * Gods = Parent users (Maybe allow them to select a God?)

## Tech
- MVP Goals:
    * [] Parent and child users can be created
    * [] Parents can create "Ships", where children can subsequently be added
    * [] Parents can create quests with rudimentary info, i.e name, task, time limit, bounty
    * [] Parents can end quest early, extend, etc. (i.e Edit quest)
    * [] Children can complete quests. Provide proof?
    * [] Bounty from quests is added to children's war chest (Name too violent?)
